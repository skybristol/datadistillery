The concept for this domain came about during work we were doing under an NSF EarthCube grant where we were working on a generalized framework for constant introspection of datasets flowing into a repository to figure out what they might align with. Much has happened since then to make the ideas we were pursuing at the time truly old school. However, the issue still remains that we have lots of messy data in the world that needs distilling into something more consumable. It's not so much syntactic messiness anymore as semantic. While AIs help us make better guesses about what's going on in a given dataset, they are expensive to operate and we can and should improve on this through better encoding of the "global knowledge commons" with the things we actually know and understand to be true.
